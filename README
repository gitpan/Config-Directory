Config/Directory - version 0.01
===============================

INTRO

Config::Directory provides an object-oriented interface to configuration 
data stored as multiple small files in one or more config directories
(something like /proc on Linux and Solaris, or 'env' directories with
qmail/daemontools). This kind of layout is very nice for some kinds of
scriptability (e.g. 'echo 10 > conf/MAXCONNECTIONS').

Basic usage:

  $c = Config::Directory->new('/usr/local/myapp/conf');

or:

  $c = Config::Directory->new([ '/usr/local/myapp/conf', "$HOME/.myapp" ]);

Each file becomes an entry in the blessed hashref $c, with the filename as
the key and the file contents as the value.

There are various optional arguments to modify the default behaviour - see
the perldoc for the details.

Currently only readonly access is available.
