Config/Directory - version 0.02
===============================

INTRO

Config::Directory provides an object-oriented interface to configuration 
data stored as multiple small files in one or more config directories.
Using individual files for config items greatly simplifies update 
interfaces and scriptability, while using multiple directories allows
distinctions between distribution and local configuration settings, for
example.

Basic usage:

  $c = Config::Directory->new('/usr/local/myapp/conf');

or:

  $c = Config::Directory->new([ '/usr/local/myapp/conf', "$HOME/.myapp" ]);

Each file becomes an entry in the blessed hashref $c, with the filename as
the key and the file contents as the value.

There are various optional arguments to modify the default behaviour - see
the perldocs for the details.

This version supports write access to config files, using a set() method:

  $c->set($name, $value)

which writes $value to the file called $name. If more than one config
directory is used, set() always used the last one in the list for writes.
A get() method is provided for consistency, equivalent to the direct
hash access.
